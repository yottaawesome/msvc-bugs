# Bad Return

## Introduction

In-class function member definitions produce unexpected results when returning values from free functions in the same module.

As of 19/06/2023, this issue has been [reported to Microsoft](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Bad-return-value-when-module-based-in-cl/10395174) and I'm waiting on a response.
