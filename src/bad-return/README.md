# Bad Return

## Introduction

In-class member function definitions produce unexpected results when returning values from free functions in the same module.

As of 19/06/2023, this issue has been [reported to Microsoft](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Bad-return-value-when-module-based-in-cl/10395174) and I'm waiting on a response.

As of 20/06/2023, Microsoft is reporting the issue has been fixed for the next major version (17.7.0) of VS 2022.
