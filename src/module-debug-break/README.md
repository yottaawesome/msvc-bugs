# Module Class Member Function Breakpoints

## Introduction

In-class member function definitions do not have their breakpoints hit as expected.

As of 20/06/2023, this issue has been [reported to Microsoft](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Debug-breakpoints-are-not-being-hit-in-m/10396206) and I'm waiting on a response.
