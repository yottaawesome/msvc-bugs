# Module Class Member Function Breakpoints

## Introduction

In-class member function definitions do not have their breakpoints hit as expected.

As of 20/06/2023, this issue has been [reported to Microsoft](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Debug-breakpoints-are-not-being-hit-in-m/10396206) and I'm waiting on a response.

Microsoft added this to their "Under consideration" queue, which is really their way of saying "we won't fix it anytime soon, if ever". Always set your bar low when you're dealing with MSFT or the MSVC team -- they're pretty inept, to put it mildly.
